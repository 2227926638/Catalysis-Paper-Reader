This study aims to elucidate the specific role of MgO as a support for Ru-BaO catalysts. \nUsing pure MgO and MgO-Al 2O3 mixed oxide (MgAlO x) with different MgO contents (MgO wt% 5, 30, and 70) \nas supports, catalysts impregnated with equal amounts of Ba and Ru were prepared and analyzed to explore their \nNH3 synthesis activity and structural properties. Our observations reveal that while MgO does not directly \npromote Ru, it maintains robust basicity of BaO, enabling BaO to effectively function as an electronic promoter. \nIn contrast, BaO supported on AlO x domain shows suppressed basicity, resulting in inertness as a promoter. \nConsequently, the Ru-Ba/MgO catalyst forms highly active Ru-BaO-MgO interfacial sites, leading to significantly \nhigher activity, lower activation energy, and a distinct reaction mechanism compared to Ru-Ba/MgAlO x cata-\nlysts. This work sheds light on the importance of sequential interactions, i.e. support –promoter and promo -\nter–active center interactions, in facilitating catalytic activity, thereby providing valuable insights essential for \nthe design of advanced catalysts.   \n1.Introduction \nAmmonia (NH 3) has played a pivotal role in advancing human \nadvancement, serving as an important source for fertilizers and a wide \nrange of industrial applications such as plastics, resins, coatings, and \nexplosives. Currently, global NH3 production stands at approximately \n200 Mt annually [1,2] . Forecasts predict a surge in demand, estimated to \nsurpass annual 600 Mt by 2050 [2], due to NH3′s emergence as a high- \ndensity energy carrier and a carbon-free fuel [3–7]. Despite its societal \nimportance, conventional ammonia synthesis via the Haber –Bosch \nprocess raises substantial environmental concerns as it uses fossil fuel- \nderived hydrogens, resulting in severe CO2 emission (F1.6 tCO2 tNH3\u00001) \n[2]. To minimize greenhouse gas emissions and leverage green H2 for \nsustainable energy, attention has turned towards NH3 synthesis under \nmilder conditions [8,9] . However, transitioning operation condition to \nmilder temperature and pressure compromises reaction kinetics, highlighting the critical necessity for advanced NH3 synthesis catalysts. \nFor over a century, Fe-based catalysts have been central to the \nHaber –Bosch process [10,11] . A notable commercial success after Fe- \nbased catalyst is the Cs and/or Ba-promoted Ru/graphitic carbon cata-\nlyst employed in the Kellogg Advanced Ammonia Process (KAAP). This \nRu catalyst shows superior activity compared to conventional Fe-based \ncatalysts, reducing the severity of NH3 plant operation and therefore \ndecrease the operation costs [12]. Regarding the reaction mechanism \nand the structural requirement of the active site, two hypotheses are \nwidely accepted as the key claim of the active catalyst. First, considering \nNH3 synthesis over Ru is structure-sensitive [13,14] , Ru particles with \nca. 2 nm are known to be the best due to the abundance of B5 sites active \nfor N2 dissociation (i.e. geometric effect) [14,15] . Second, electron- \nenriched Ru facilitates electron backdonation to reactant N2, thereby \naccelerating the dissociation of N⊇N bond, the generally thought rate- \ndetermining step (i.e. electronic effect) [16–18].

In particular, \nthe superiority of MgO compared to other oxide supports is thoroughly \naddressed in a pioneering study by Aika and coworkers [32]. Further -\nmore, MgO stands out in many attractive points as a support due to its \neconomic feasibility and high thermal stability. Many researchers have \nspeculated that the superiority of MgO is attributed to its basicity, which \npromotes high electron density in supported Ru particles [38]. However, \nthere are still some controversial perspectives on the role of MgO. Lar-\nichev et al. demonstrated the Ru particles supported on MgO have \npositive rather than negative charges through a rigorous X-ray photo -\nelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study [39,40] . They argued that this feature \nis the reason for the necessity of the basic promoters. Recent studies \nfrom our group have elucidated that the Ru-BaO interfacial area pri-\nmarily determines the NH3 synthesis activity of the Ru-Ba/MgO catalyst \neven at the same composition [35]. This interface facilitates the splitting \nof H atoms into H/e\u0000pairs, segregating them as H@BaO and e\u0000@Ru \nentities, thereby enriching the electron density of Ru and suppressing \nhydrogen poisoning. Further insights from density functional theory \n(DFT) calculations indicated that MgO may not promote H splitting and \nseparate storage due to its weak basicity [35]. In contrast, Tsang and his \ncolleagues proposed the promoting role of the MgO(1 11) facet [34]. \nThe authors suggested that MgO(1 11), which has an exceptionally high \nelectrostatic polarity (i.e. basicity) compared to other MgO facets, is able \nto capture Hto alleviate hydrogen poisoning of Ru particles and thus is \nbeneficial for NH3 synthesis. These divergent observations stimulate \ncuriosity about the genuine electronic promoting role of the MgO. \nThis work aims to investigate the advantageous role of MgO as a \nsupport for Ru-BaO catalysts in NH3 synthesis. We undertake a \ncomparative study using pure MgO and MgO-Al 2O3 mixed oxide \n(MgAlO x) supports with different MgO contents (MgO wt% 5, 30, and \n70). The catalytic activity shows a strong positive correlation with the \nMgO content of the support. A series of analyses reveal that MgO itself \ndoes not directly promote Ru, but it indirectly contributes to the pro-\nmotion of the catalyst by imparting strong basicity to BaO, allowing BaO \nto play as an electronic promoter. This work highlights the pivotal role \nof sequential interactions, especially the support –promoter and pro-\nmoter –active center interactions, in tailoring catalytic activity. \n2.Experimental section \n2.1. Materials \nMg-Al mixed hydroxy carbonate, i.e. PURAL MG5 (MgO:Al 2O3 \n5:95), PURAL MG30 (MgO:Al 2O3 30:70), and PURAL MG70 (MgO: \nAl2O3 70:30), were purchased from SASOL Chemicals. MgO (99.9 %) \nwas purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ba(NO 3)2 (≽99 %), Ru3(CO) 12 (99 \n%), and tetrahydrofuran (THF, HPLC grade) were purchased from \nSigma-Aldrich. NaOH (F97 %) was purchased from Samchun \nChemicals. \n2.2. Catalyst preparation \nTo prepare a porous MgO, 10 g of commercial bulk MgO was hy-\ndrothermally treated with 0.046 M NaOH aqueous solution at 353 K for \n4 h with vigorous stirring and recovered by filtration and thorough \nwashing until the supernatant solution reaches pH 7. The recovered \nsample was dried at 373 K for 12 h, and then calcined in a muffle furnace \nat 823 K for 4 h under air flow. To obtain MgAlO x, the Mg-Al mixed \nhydroxy carbonates were calcined at 823 K for 4 h under air flow. The obtained samples are denoted as MgOn, where n is the MgO/(MgO \nAl2O3) wt% in the precursor (n 5, 30, 70, and 100). \nTo synthesize Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts, Ba was first supported on the \nMgOn. Typically, 5 g of MgOn was impregnated with 1.307 g of Ba \n(NO 3)2 dissolved in 50 cm3 of deionized (DI) water, and the solvent \nwater was evaporated at 353 K under vacuum to load a nominal Ba \ncontent of 1.0 mmol gsupport\u00001. The Ba-impregnated sample was then \nthermally treated at 823 K for 2 h with N2 flow in a tube furnace. Next, 5 \nwt% Ru was impregnated on Ba/MgO n using Ru3(CO) 12 as the Ru pre-\ncursor. The 0.633 g of Ru3(CO) 12 was first dissolved in 63 cm3 of THF, \nand vigorously mixed with 5.7 g of synthesized Ba/MgO n while evap-\norating the solvent at 323 K under vacuum. The dried sample was then \nreduced at 823 K for 2 h under H2 flow in a tube furnace. The ramp rate \nwas 5 •C min\u00001 for all heat treatments. \n2.3. Catalytic reaction \nThe catalytic NH3 synthesis reaction was carried out in a stainless \nsteel fixed-bed plug-flow reactor. Typically, 0.5 g of the sieved catalyst \npellets (500 –850 μm) were loaded into the reactor (3/8 in. inner \ndiameter), and pretreated at 773 K for 2 h under N2/H2 (1/3 molar) \nmixed gas flow (50 cm3 min\u00001). After pretreatment, the reactor was \nconditioned to the target temperature and then pressurized under N2/H2 \nmixed gas flow (150 cm3 min\u00001). The catalytic activity was measured at \n5 MPa, N2/H2 1/3, while varying weight hourly space velocity \n(WHSV) and reaction temperature. Unless otherwise noted, the results in \nthis manuscript are measured at 4 h of time-on-stream, when the reac-\ntion has reached steady state. The outlet gas stream was monitored by a \ngas chromatography (GC, Agilent 6890N) equipped with a thermal \nconductivity detector and a Porapak Q column (Agilent). The weight- \ntime-yield of NH3 (WTY NH3) over the catalyst is calculated using the \nfollowing Eq. (1) [41]. \nWTY NH3cNH3\n1cNH3×Mw NH3×WHSV\n22400(1)  \nwhere cNH3 is the NH3 concentration (0 ≼cNH3 ≼1) of the outlet gas \nstream and MwNH3 is the molecular weight of NH3 (i.e. 17 g mol\u00001). \nThe apparent activation energy was determined by the Arrhenius \nequation while varying the reaction temperature from 668 to 693 K. The \nreaction order for NH3 was determined using Eq. (2) proposed by Hagen \net al [42]. \nlnPNH31\n1\u0000γln1\nFC (2)  \nwhere γ is the reaction order for NH3, PNH3 is the partial pressure of NH3, \nand F is flow rate. \n2.4. Catalyst characterization \nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a SmartLab \nHigh Resolution (Rigaku) analyzer equipped with a Cu Kα (1.5406 Å) \nradiation source (200 mA and 40 kV). Peaks for standard materials were \nobtained using MATCH! phase analysis software. \nN2 adsorption –desorption isotherms of the catalysts were obtained at \n77 K using a Tristar II 3020 volumetric sorption analyzer (Micro -\nmeritics). Prior to measurement, the samples were degassed at 623 K for \n5 h under vacuum conditions. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area \n(SBET) was calculated from the N2 adsorption curve at the P/P0 \n0.05 –0.25, and the total pore volume (Vpore) was calculated at the P/P0 \n0.99. \nHigh-resolution field emission transmission electron microscopy \n(HR-FE-TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission \nelectron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were measured using an F200 in-\nstrument (JEOL Ltd., Japan) at 200 kV acceleration voltage. Energy \ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using a JED-2300T K. Lee et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nJournal of Catalysis 434 (2024) 115530\n3EDS analyzer (JEOL Ltd.). All TEM micrographs were taken with a Rio \n16 CMOS camera (Gatan). The surface-weighted average diameter of Ru \nparticles (dRu,EM ) was determined using the following Eq. (3) by \ncounting more than 100 Ru particles in HAADF-STEM images. \ndRuCEM⋃nid3\ni⋃nid2\ni(3)  \nwhere ni is the number of particles with a diameter di. \nThe dispersion of Ru particles was investigated by H2 and CO \nchemisorption using an ASAP2020 (Micromeritics) volumetric sorption \nanalyzer. Prior to measurement, the samples were reduced at 673 K for \n2 h under H2 flow and degassed at the same temperature for 2 h under \nhigh vacuum. The H2 and CO adsorption were performed at 323 K, and \nthe chemisorbed amounts were determined by extrapolating the linear \npart of the isotherms (6–28 kPa) to zero pressure. Dispersion of Ru was \nobtained by assuming that the stoichiometric factors for Ru/H 2 and Ru/ \nCO are 2 and 1, respectively. The number of surface Ru atoms of the \ncatalyst (NRu surf) is calculated based on H2 chemisorption. \nTemperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO 2-TPD) was \nmeasured using an AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics) instrument \nequipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Typically, 0.05 g \nof the sieved pellets (500 –850 μm) were loaded into the U-shaped tube \nand pretreated with He or H2 flow at 673 K for 1 h, and then cooled \ndown to the 323 K. Then, 10 % CO2/He was injected into the sample \nchamber for 1 h, and weakly bound CO2 was desorbed by He purging for \n1 h at the same temperature. The desorption profile was measured from \n323 to 973 K with a ramp rate of 20 K min\u00001 using He (30 cm3 min\u00001) as \na carrier gas. Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH 3-TPD) \nwas measured in a similar manner using 10 % NH3/He as the adsorption \ngas instead of 10 % CO2/He. \nXPS was performed using an Axis-Supra (Kratos) equipped with a \nmonochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.7 eV). Prior to the mea-\nsurement, all samples were pretreated by H2 flow at 773 K for 2 h and \ntransferred directly to the analytical chamber without air exposure using \na lab-made gas treatment system equipped with a glove box. Peak \ndeconvolution was conducted by XPSpeak41 software. To deconvolute \nthe Ru 3d–C 1s overlapped signals, the peak position of C 1s was fixed to \n248.8 eV and a pair of Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 doublets with a spin–orbit \nsplitting ratio of 1.5 and a binding energy gap (Δ) of 4.2 eV was used. \n3.Results and discussion \n3.1. Characterization of MgO and MgAlO x supports \nA porous MgO, denoted as MgO100, was synthesized via a hydro -\nthermal treatment of commercially available bulk MgO, followed by \nsubsequent calcination. In addition, a series of MgO-Al 2O3 mixed oxi-\ndes—namely MgO70, MgO30, and MgO5, where the number indicates \nthe weight percent of MgO in the support material (details are given in \nthe experimental section) —were prepared by calcinating commercial \nMg-Al hydroxy carbonates. The results of powder X-ray diffraction \n(XRD) analysis are presented in Fig. 1. MgO100 exhibits characteristic \npeaks at 2θ values of 36.8•, 42.8•, and 62•, which correspond to the \ncubic MgO crystal. MgO70 shows peaks related to those of cubic MgO, \nwith notable shifts in the positions of MgO (200) and (220) peaks to-\nwards higher angles. This peak shift hints the formation of MgO-Al 2O3 \nsolid solution of which smaller Al3ion (68 pm) substitutes a lattice \nMg2cation (86 pm) in the MgO. This substitution introduces an excess \npositive charge, necessitating the insertion of additional O2\u0000ions near \nthe Al3sites in stoichiometric amounts to maintain charge balance. The \nchemical formula of the MgO-Al 2O3 solid solution, with a Mg:Al molar \nratio of a:b, can be nominally represented as MgaAlbOa1.5b. Conse -\nquently, structural alterations in the cubic MgO lattice, such as the \npresence of O adatoms, cation vacancies, and/or lattice disorder, may \noccur. The extent of peak shift becomes more pronounced as the Al content within the support material increases. The XRD pattern of MgO5 \nclosely resembles that of γ-Al2O3, with Al2O3 being the major compo -\nnent (i.e. 95 wt%). MgO30 exhibits characteristic peaks of both Al- \nsubstituted MgO solid solution and γ-Al2O3, resulting in broader peaks \ncompared to other MgOn materials. Conventionally, the calcination of \nMg-Al hydrotalcite at temperatures above 973 K is known to result in the \nformation of MgAl 2O4 spinel [43]. However, our analysis does not \nidentify the presence of MgAl 2O4 spinel, possibly due to the relatively \nlower calcination temperature of 823 K employed in our study. \nN2 adsorption –desorption isotherm of the MgOn supports is shown in \nFig. S1a. MgO100, MgO70, MgO30, and MgO5 have BET surface areas \n(SBET) of 32, 192, 235, and 250 m2 g\u00001, respectively. There is a \ndiscernible trend of increasing SBET as well as total pore volume (Vtotal) \nwith increasing Al content within the support material. BJH pore size \ndistribution shows that samples with more Al have smaller pores, while \nMgO100, the pure MgO, has pores larger than 50 nm, suggesting the \npredominant presence of interparticular pores (Fig. S1b). \n3.2. Characterization of Ru-Ba/MgO and Ru-Ba/MgAlO x catalysts \nIn order to prepare NH3 synthesis catalysts, Ba and Ru were \nsequentially impregnated onto the MgOn supports. Nominally, the Ru \ncontent of the catalysts is 5 wt% and the Ba/Ru molar ratio of the cat-\nalysts is approximately 1.7 under the specified synthesis conditions. The \nN2 isotherm and corresponding pore structural properties of the Ru-Ba/ \nMgOn catalysts are shown in Fig. S2 and Table 1, respectively. Although \nthere is slight decrease in SBET and Vtotal after Ba and Ru impregnation, \nthe SBET and Vtotal follow the same order as the supports: Ru-Ba/ \nMgO100 DRu-Ba/MgO70 DRu-Ba/MgO30 DRu-Ba/MgO5. \nAs shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern of resultant Ru-Ba/MgO n cat-\nalysts shows the characteristic peaks of BaO crystals (2θ 24.2, 28.0, \n34.5, and 45.0•). In particular, the BaO peaks are more prominent in Ru- \nFig. 1.Powder XRD patterns of MgOn support materials.  \nTable 1 \nStructural properties of MgOn supports and Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts.  \nCatalyst Mg/(Mg \nAl) SBET (m2 \ng\u00001)a Vtotal (cm3 \ng\u00001)b dRu,EM \n(nm)c NRu surf \n(μmol g\u00001)d \nRu-Ba/ \nMgO100 1 34  0.15  6.81 243 \nRu-Ba/ \nMgO70 0.75 106  0.20  3.67 254 \nRu-Ba/ \nMgO30 0.35 159  0.37  1.46 246 \nRu-Ba/ \nMgO5 0.06 176  0.37  0.93 45  \naBET surface area. \nbTotal pore volume. \ncAverage Ru particle size determined by HAADF-STEM. \ndNumber of surface Ru atoms calculated by H2 chemisorption.

Simultaneously, only Ru-Ba/ \nMgO100 shows a peak indicative of Ru crystal (i.e. 2θ 42.2•), indi-\ncating the formation of relatively large Ru particles. The other catalysts \ndo not show any discernible Ru crystal peaks, signifying a high disper -\nsion of Ru particles throughout the catalysts. Moreover, all catalysts \nretain the characteristic peaks of the support material (Fig. 1), indicating \nthat the addition of Ba and Ru species does not alter the crystalline phase \nof the support. \nHAADF-STEM imaging coupled with EDS elemental mapping reveals \nthat the BaO domain with an average layer thickness of 2 to 5 nm coats \nthe MgO surface in Ru-Ba/MgO100 (Fig. 2b). Ru nanoparticles, ranging \nin size from 2 to 10 nm, are deposited on the BaO-coated MgO domain, \nestablishing close proximity with the BaO particles. In contrast, BaO \nappears to be uniformly dispersed throughout the MgO-Al 2O3 domain \n(Fig. 2c–e). On the Mg-deficient supports, the associations between Ru \nparticle and BaO particle are not as distinct as Ru-Ba/MgO100. The Ru \nparticle size is significantly affected by the type of support. Notably, as \nthe Al content of the support increases, there is a gradual decrease in the \naverage size of Ru particles (Fig. 2f–i). Specifically, in Al-absent Ru-Ba/ \nMgO100, predominantly Ru nanoparticles with dRu,EM 6.81 nm are \nobserved (Fig. 2b and 2f). In contrast, Ru-Ba/MgO5, with the highest Al \ncontent, exhibits a significant portion of atomically dispersed Ru species \nsuch as single atom, atomic clusters, and subnanometric clusters (Fig. 2e \nand 2i). This intriguing phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of \nγ-Al2O3 domain in the support. The γ-Al2O3 possesses coordinatively \nunsaturated penta-coordinated Al3centers that can strongly anchor the \nnoble metal species [44,45] , thereby stabilizing extremely small Ru \nclusters on the surface. Ru particles supported on MgO5 show a bimodal \ndistribution, probably due to the size-dependent ripening and/or the \nheterogeneity of the surface of MgO5. The result indicates that beyond a \ncertain threshold, i.e. 0.4 nm, Ru particles are facile to be sintered to a bigger particle during thermal processes. \nThe dispersion of Ru was further characterized through H2 and CO \nchemisorption (Fig. 3a). It is widely recognized that the dispersion of the \nmetal particles is inversely correlated with the average particle diam -\neter. The theoretical relationship between the average particle diameter \n(dRu) and dispersion (DRu) specifically for Ru is described as follows. \nDRu6vRuEaRu\ndRu×100% (4)  \nwhere vRu is the volume of a single Ru atom in the bulk (i.e. 13.65 Å3), \nand aRu is the area of a single Ru atom on the surface (i.e. 6.35 Å2) [46]. \nThis equation is useful for the particles larger than about 1.3 nm. \nAs confirmed during HAADF-STEM analyses (Fig. 2f–i), the prepared \ncatalysts have an average Ru particle size (dRu,EM ) order of Ru-Ba/MgO5 \nDRu-Ba/MgO30 DRu-Ba/MgO70 DRu-Ba/MgO100. However, the \nchemisorption results present that DRu follows the order of Ru-Ba/MgO5 \n≪Ru-Ba/MgO30 ≪Ru-Ba/MgO70 FRu-Ba/MgO100 (Fig. 3a). The \ncatalysts Ru-Ba/MgO5 and Ru-Ba/MgO30 show markedly lower values \n(ca. 50 %) compared to the theoretical values calculated from Eq. (4) \n(F86 %). Ru-Ba/MgO100 also displays significantly lower experimental \nvalues (5.3–9.1 %) than the theoretical value (19 %). \nTo elucidate these counterintuitive observations, we prepared Ba- \nfree control catalysts —namely, Ru/MgO5, Ru/MgO30, Ru/MgO70, \nand Ru/MgO100 —and quantified their Ru dispersion. As depicted in \nFig. S3, TEM analysis indicates that the Ru particle size distribution of \nRu/MgO n is very similar to that of Ru-Ba/MgO n, suggesting the support \nprimarily determines the Ru particle size distribution. H2 and CO \nchemisorption demonstrate that Ru/MgO5 and Ru/MgO30 again exhibit \nsimilar Ru dispersions (ca. 50 %) even in the absence of Ba (Fig. 3b), \nimplying that excessively small Ru particles inherently show low \nchemisorption values.

In \ncontrast, Ru/MgO70 and Ru/MgO100 demonstrate high consistency \nbetween theoretical and experimental values. In particular, Ru/MgO100 \nshows significantly higher dispersion (17–22 %; Fig. 3b) compared to \nRu-Ba/MgO100 (Fig. 3a). The result indicates that densely coated BaO \nmay hinder the access of probe molecules to the Ru sites in Ru-Ba/ \nMgO100. The large disparity between H2 chemisorption (9.1 %) and \nCO chemisorption (5.3 %) in Ru-Ba/MgO100 reinforces this speculation \nas CO has larger kinetic diameter (3.8 Å) than H2 (2.9 Å) [47]. \n3.3. Ammonia synthesis performance and reaction kinetic studies \nThe NH3 synthesis performance of Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts was eval-\nuated at 5 MPa, WHSV 18,000 cm3 gcat.\u00001h\u00001, N2/H2 1/3 while \nvarying the reaction temperature. The weight-time-yield of NH3 over the \ncatalysts (WTY NH3) as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 4a. \nDuring the reaction, no deactivation was observed for about 8 h \n(Fig. S4a), and the TEM image of the used catalysts, Ru-Ba/MgO100 and \nRu-Ba/MgO5, shows no significant changes in the Ru particle size dis-\ntribution after the reaction (Fig. S4b and S4c). There is a positive cor-\nrelation between the catalytic activity and the MgO content of the Ru- \nBa/MgO n catalysts (Ru-Ba/MgO5 DRu-Ba/MgO30 DRu-Ba/MgO70 D\nRu-Ba/MgO100) in the temperature range of 668–693 K, confirming the \nsuperiority of MgO as well as the inferiority of Al2O3 as a support. For a \ncomparison, the activity of Ru/MgO n catalysts at 678 K was also eval-\nuated (inset in Fig. 4a). Typically, the catalysts show an order of \nmagnitude lower activity compared to Ru-Ba/MgO100. In addition, \nthere is only a marginal difference between the Ru/MgO n catalysts. \nThese observations indicate that the support itself has a negligible direct effect on the activity of Ru. \nIn turn, the turnover frequencies (TOF) for NH3 synthesis at 678 K of \nRu/MgO n and Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts are represented in Fig. 4b. In the \nTOF calculation, the accessible Ru sites acquired by H2 chemisorption \nwere used as the denominator. Firstly, all Ba-free Ru/MgO n catalysts \nexhibited relatively similar TOFs ranging from 6.3 to 16 mol NH3 mol Ru \nsurf\u00001 h\u00001, again confirming that the support composition does not \nhugely affect the catalytic activity for Ba-free Ru catalysts. However, \nthere is a positive correlation between TOF and MgO content within the \nsupport for Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts. In particular, Ru-Ba/MgO5 showed a \nsimilar TOF (12 mol NH3 mol Ru surf\u00001 h\u00001) to that of Ru/MgO5 catalyst (9.8 \nmol NH3 mol Ru surf\u00001 h\u00001), indicating the negligible effect of the BaO pro-\nmoter. Conversely, on supports such as MgO30, MgO70 and MgO100, \nthe addition of Ba increased the TOF of the catalysts (Ru-Ba/MgO n F\nRu/MgO n). Of note, the Ru-Ba/MgO100 exhibited a TOF two orders of \nmagnitude higher (828 mol NH3 mol Ru surf \u00001 h\u00001) than Ba-free catalysts. \nThese results highlight the importance of the support composition on the \ncatalytic activity of Ru-BaO composite catalyst, where MgO maximizes \nthe efficacy of the BaO promoter while AlO x inhibits it. \nThe effect of support composition on the catalytic activity was \nfurther investigated through a reaction kinetics study. The apparent \nactivation energy (Ea) gradually decreases from 154 kJ mol\u00001 to 42 kJ \nmol\u00001 as the catalyst contains higher MgO content in the support (Ru- \nBa/MgO5 FRu-Ba/MgO30 FRu-Ba/MgO70 FRu-Ba/MgO100; \nFig. 4c). This trend reinforces the advantages of MgO support for \naccelerating NH3 synthesis compared to MgAlO x supports. The low \nactivation energy of 42 kJ mol\u00001 is comparable to that of some state-of- \nthe-art catalysts [38], suggesting the high potential of Ru-Ba/MgO for \nlow-temperature applications. To better understand the role of support \nand Ba species, the apparent activation energy of Ba-free Ru/MgO100 \nwas also measured. The result demonstrates that Ru/MgO100 shows a \nrelatively high Ea of 143 kJ mol\u00001 (Fig. S5), which is similar to that of \nRu-Ba/MgO5 and Ru-Ba/MgO30. In addition, Fig. 4d shows the reaction \norder for NH3 (γ) of the Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts in NH3 synthesis. While \nmost catalysts have γ around 0, only Ru-Ba/MgO100 has a huge negative \nvalue (\u00000.55) which indicates a strong interaction between NH3 and \ncatalyst surface. All these observations point to the uniqueness of MgO \nas a support. Contrary to AlO x, MgO tailors the nature of Ru-BaO to be \nmore active. Accordingly, it allows the NH3 synthesis to follow a much \nkinetically favored pathway. \n3.4. On the role of MgO within Ru-Ba/support catalytic system \nOver the past four decades, extensive research has been dedicated to \ninvestigating the Ru/support and Ru/BaO/support systems. Throughout \nthis period, numerous hypotheses have emerged in attempts to elucidate \nthe active sites. Among these, the influence of Ru particle size, often \nreferred to as the geometric effect, has been widely discussed as a critical \nparameter governing NH3 synthesis activity [14,15,31,48 –51]. Early \ninvestigations by Jacobsen et al. underscored the structure sensitivity of \nRu catalysts for NH3 synthesis, suggesting that Ru particles in the range \nof 1.8–2.5 nm maximize the probability of active B5 site formation [14]. \nSubsequent studies, such as those conducted by Rar˘og-Pilecka et al., \nhave corroborated this trend in catalytic activity concerning the number \nof B5 sites in Ru particles D2 nm, yet discrepancies arise with larger Ru \nparticles (F2 nm) [52]. It has been postulated that Ba may serve as a \ngeometric promoter, facilitating the creation of additional B5 sites in \nrelatively larger Ru particles. Recent investigations have introduced \nmore nuanced perspectives on the geometric effect. For instance, \nFern˘andez et al. proposed that larger average Ru particles, along with a \nbroad size distribution, are more effective for NH3 synthesis [48]. In \ncontrast, Jiang and his coworkers demonstrated that smaller Ru particles \nexhibit superior performance in Ru/BaCeO 3 [49] and Ru-Ba/N-doped C \ncatalytic systems [50], with atomic Ru clusters possibly representing the \noptimal configuration [31]. \nThe electronic effect represents another crucial aspect in elucidating \nFig. 3.Ru dispersions obtained by H2 chemisorption and CO chemisorption for \n(a) Ru-Ba/MgO n and (b) Ru/MgO n catalysts. The curve shows the theoretical \nvalue obtained from Eq. (4). For the catalysts, dRu,EM was applied for dRu. K. Lee et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nJournal of Catalysis 434 (2024) 115530\n6the activity of Ru catalysts. In a study using Si3N4, MgAl 2O4, and C as \nsupports, Hansen et al. demonstrated that the impact of the Ba promoter \nvaried significantly depending on the support type [53]. Specifically, the \nobserved enhancement in catalytic activity following Ba addition could \nnot be solely attributed to the Ru dispersion effect, emphasizing the \nsignificance of electronic promotion. Siporin and Davis further noted an \nincrease in the turnover frequency (TOF) of Ru catalysts subsequent to \nthe introduction of Cs, Ba, or La promoters, suggesting that these pro-\nmoters primarily exert an electronic effect, leading to the creation of \nnew highly active sites [37]. Our previous investigation strengthened \nthis hypothesis by elucidating the specific active site which originates \nfrom hydrogen splitting [35]. \nIt is often difficult to distinguish between geometric and electronic \neffects. For example, Jiang and co-workers who suggested the impor -\ntance of the geometric effect, found that atomic Ru clusters are more \nelectron-rich than Ru particles of other sizes [31]. Therefore, to \ncomprehensively understand the role of MgO in the Ru-Ba/support \nsystem, it is imperative to discern the influence of both geometric and \nelectronic effects. In our study, the Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts possess \ndifferent Ru particle sizes, and the catalytic activity seemingly increases \nproportionally to the average Ru particle size. However, the particle size \neffect is unclear in Ba-free catalysts (Fig. S6), and the activity is heavily \ndependent on the presence of Ba. Thus, our observations align with some \nof the earlier viewpoint that the electronic effect, namely the interaction \nbetween Ru and BaO, can prevail over geometric effect and governs the \ncatalytic activity of Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts. \nThe interaction between Ru and BaO can be determined through \nCO2-TPD analysis of catalysts. To elucidate how it is affected by the \nsupport, we conducted CO2-TPD experiments on both pristine MgOn supports and Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts after pretreatment with He or H2 at \n773 K (Fig. 5a). In the CO2-TPD profiles of the supports (grey curves), \nthe peak at 393 K for all samples can be attributed to weakly bound CO2 \non the surface. The desorption signal in the range of 523–773 K indicates \nstrongly bound CO2 on the surface. Notably, MgO100 displays higher \nCO2 desorption signals overall, as well as a larger fraction of strongly \nbound CO2 compared to the other supports. Meanwhile, MgO70, \nMgO30, and MgO5 show highly similar profiles each other. MgO100 has \nno peak above 823 K, while MgO70, MgO30, and MgO5 have a peak at \n903 K. Since the supports were calcined at 823 K during the synthesis, \nthe high temperature peaks can be assigned to the desorption of CO2 or \nH2O originally present in the hydrotalcite precursors. \nThe CO2-TPD profiles of the Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts are also repre -\nsented in Fig. 5a (red curves). All catalysts show a marginal increase in \nthe low temperature peak compared to their respective supports. How-\never, the increase in the high temperature signals (F473 K) is highly \ndependent on the support. The increment following the addition of Ba \nand Ru is more pronounced on the support with higher MgO content. \nNotably, Ru-Ba/MgO100 shows drastically increased CO2 desorption \ncompared to MgO100, showcasing that the strong basicity is created \nafter Ba addition. These results highlight the different nature of BaO \ndepending on the support material. Contrary to the common belief that \nit is a strongly basic oxide, BaO is basic when in MgO but is hardly basic \nwhen supported on AlO x domains. \nThe nature of active site for Ru-Ba/MgO100 was further studied. \nNotably, there are two sharp peaks in the TPD profile of Ru-Ba/MgO100, \nthe peaks at 573 K and 843 K. Previous studies have indicated that the \npeak at 573 K represents the CO2 from Ru–BaO interface and the peak at \n843 K indicates the CO2 from discrete BaO particles [35].

Meanwhile, for other catalysts, the change in \nCO2 desorption profile after H2 pretreatment is negligible, representing \na limited interaction between Ru and BaO. \nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), involving H2 pretreatment \nat 773 K and excluding air exposure, was conducted to further investi -\ngate the electronic state of reduced Ru particles. The analysis focused on \ntwo catalysts, Ru-Ba/MgO100 and Ru-Ba/MgO5, chosen for their the \nmost striking differences in catalytic activity. Additionally, Ba-free Ru/ \nMgO100 was examined to differentiate the influence of Ba. In the Ru 3d \nXPS spectra (Fig. 5c), Ru/MgO100 exhibits peaks at 280.3 eV and 284.5 \neV, corresponding to the typical peaks for Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 of \nmetallic Ru, respectively. Notably, Ru-Ba/MgO100 displays a significant \nred shift (approximately 0.3 eV) in the Ru 3d peaks, indicating the \nelectron accumulation on Ru particles facilitated by BaO. In contrast, \nRu-Ba/MgO5 exhibits a Ru 3d distribution highly similar to that of Ru/ \nMgO100, suggesting negligible electronic interactions between Ru and BaO. Similar results were observed in the Ru 3p XPS analyses (Fig. S8). \nSimilarly, we performed TPD of NH3, which is a basic probe molecule \nas well as the product of the reaction of our interest. As shown in Fig. 6a, \nMgO100 exceptionally shows the strongly bound NH3 signals (peak at \n563 K) while MgAlO x supports (MgO70, MgO30, and MgO5) mainly \nshow weakly bound NH3 signals. Notably, Ru-Ba/MgO100 exhibits \nsignificantly decreased NH3 desorption signals compared to MgO100, \nagain confirming the strong basicity of BaO. However, all other Ru-Ba/ \nMgOn catalysts show similar TPD profile to their support, indicating the \nsuppressed basicity of MgAlO x-supported BaO. Given that Al3possesses \nsignificantly higher electronegativity (1.513) than Ba2(1.126) [54], \nthe basicity of BaO may be titrated by the Al2O3 domain, while the \nrelatively neutral nature of MgO (electronegativity of Mg21.234 \n[54]) tends to preserve the basicity of BaO. The effect of H2 pretreatment \non the Ru-Ba/MgO n catalysts was also investigated in NH3-TPD \n(Fig. 6b). H2 pretreatment on Ru-Ba/MgO5, Ru-Ba/MgO30, and Ru-Ba/ \nMgO70 catalysts hardly changes the high-temperature signals (F523 K). \nOn the other hand, in the Ru-Ba/MgO100 catalyst, a large increase in the \nhigh temperature peak is noticeable after H2 treatment. That is, the \nsurface of Ru-Ba/MgO100, more specifically, the H@BaO and e–@Ru \nentities, exceptionally stabilizes the adsorption of NH3. This result is \ncoherent with the reaction kinetics analyses that only Ru-Ba/MgO100 \nshowed a highly negative reaction order for NH3, which could imply \nthe stabilization of NHx intermediates. \nCombining all these observations can provide an understanding of \nthe activity and apparent activation energies, which differ markedly \ndepending on the MgO content of the support (Scheme 1). Firstly, the \nRu-BaO site interfacing with the AlO x domain may be a weak active site \nlike bare Ru, since the BaO has lost its function as an electronic pro-\nmoter. Such a site is likely vulnerable to hydrogen poisoning and pre-\nsents a high energy barrier for activating inert N2 molecule. On the other \nhand, the Ru-BaO site in contact with the MgO domain is a strengthened \nactive site where hydrogen poisoning is mitigated, N2 activation is \nfacilitated, and NHx intermediates are possibly stabilized due to the \nefficient functioning of BaO as a promoter. This distinction suggests a \npotential alteration in the rate-determining step, signifying a substantial \nshift in the reaction pathway. The observations in our study robustly \nconfirm the speculation that a basic or inert support is suitable for Ru- \nbased NH3 synthesis catalysts [53]. Furthermore, these insights \ncontribute to the understanding of efforts to promote Ba-containing Ru- \nbased catalysts, particularly those that incorporate additional elements \nto enhance the basicity of Ba species [26,55,56] . \nFig. 5.(a) CO2-TPD profiles of MgOn and Ru-Ba/MgO n after He pretreatment. \n(b) CO2-TPD profiles of Ru-Ba/MgO n depending on the pretreatment condition \n(He or H2).

Investigation on the mass transfer limitations \nIn order to understand the mass transfer property of the catalytic \nsystem, the effects of external and internal mass transfer limitations \nwere evaluated using the Mears criterion and the Weisz –Prater criterion, \nrespectively. First, the external mass transfer limitations can be ignored \nif the Mears criterion [Eq. (5)] is satisfied [57]. \nMears numberNMears\u0000rACobs×ρcatCp×RcatCp×n\nkc×CACbulkD0B15 (5)  \nwhere \u0000rA,obs is the observed reaction rate (kmol kgcat.\u00001 s\u00001); ρcat,p is the \ncatalyst pellet bed density (kgcat. m\u00003); Rcat,p is the catalyst pellet radius \n(m); n is the reaction order of reactant A; kc is the mass transfer coeffi -\ncient for reactant A at the given condition (m s\u00001); CA,bulk is the con-\ncentration of reactant A in the bulk gas phase in kmol m\u00003. \nIn this study, we use N2 as the molecule of interest as it is generally \nassumed that N2, a kinetically larger molecule than H2 may suffer \ndiffusion limitation much easily. The detailed estimation procedure of \neach parameter is summarized in Table S1, and the obtained values of \neach parameter for the catalytic reaction at 678 K and 5 MPa are sum-\nmarized in Table 2. All Ru-Ba/MgO n catalytic systems have a Mears \nnumber (NMears) significantly lower than 0.15 and thus satisfy the \ncriterion. \nIf we postulate that the observed reaction rate is an intrinsic property \nof the catalyst —the \u0000rN2,obs has measured under the reaction kinetics- \ncontrolled regime —then the NMears relies solely on Rcat,p and ρcat,p. \nWhile variations in Rcat,p might affect ρcat,p, our analysis reveals that ρcat, \np remains relatively constant across different pellet sizes (Fig. S9). \nTherefore, the NMears can be expressed as a function of Rcat,p, and their \ncorrelation for the Ru-Ba/MgO100 catalyst is shown in Fig. 7. Our \nestimation indicates that a catalyst pellet radius of about 6.6 mm is the \nupper limit for Ru-Ba/MgO100 to exclude the external mass transfer limitations. \nThe internal mass transfer limitation was studied by estimating the \nWeisz –Prater criterion. The Weisz –Prater number (NW–P) can be calcu -\nlated by the following Eq.

For a \nspherical pellet, the η can be expressed as Eq. (8) and therefore ϕ and η \ncan be derived via Eq. (6) to Eq. (8). \nη3\nϕ2ϕcothϕ\u00001 (8) \nSimilarly, using N2 as the probe molecule, we have outlined in \nTable S2 the methods employed for estimating the parameters used in \nthe Weisz –Prater criterion, with the corresponding values depicted in \nTable 3. Notably, all Ru-Ba/MgO n catalytic systems exhibit a NW–P \nsignificantly below 1, indicating of minimal internal mass transfer lim-\nitations. At the same time, the values of ϕ are significantly less than 1 \nand η is approximately 1 for all catalytic systems. \nSince the internal mass transfer is hugely affected by the catalyst \npellet size as well as the internal diffusivity of the reactant molecule, we \naimed to obtain the criterion for the catalyst pellet size and pore size for \nthe Ru-Ba/MgO100 catalyst to avoid internal diffusion limitation. \nAssuming that the other parameters are constant, we can estimate the \nvalues of ϕ and η as a function of Rcat,p, which are shown in Fig. 8a. The \nresult shows that η can be greater than 0.95 if Rcat,p is less than 23 mm. \nCombining the results from Figs. 7 and 8a, it can be concluded that both \nexternal and internal mass transfer limitations can be avoided when the \npellet radius of Ru-Ba/MgO100 is less than 6.6 mm. \nFinally, the η was calculated by simultaneously varying the pellet \nradius (Rcat,p) and the pore diameter (dp) of the Ru-Ba/MgO100 catalyst. \nFor this study, only dp F3 nm were examined because the mean free path of N2 under reaction conditions is about 3 nm (Table S3). We first \nfixed the Rcat,p to 0.313 mm (i.e. the typical experimental condition) and \nestimated the η as a function of dp. The result demonstrates that the η is \nclose to 1 regardless of the dp (Fig. 8b). Similar examinations were \ncarried out for Rcat,p 3 mm and 6.6 mm, respectively. As the pellet size \nincreases, the effectiveness factor becomes smaller especially in the \nsmall pore range (D10 nm). Nevertheless, for a pellet with Rcat,p 6.6 \nmm (i.e. the maximum size for which external diffusion limitation can \nbe negligible), the effectiveness factor remains above 0.94 even with a \nminimum dp of 3 nm. This indicates a negligible influence of pore size on \ninternal diffusion limitation. In fact, powder, pellets sieved at 500–850 \nmm, and pellets sieved at 1.0–1.5 mm for Ru-Ba/MgO100 all show \nsimilar activity (Fig. S10), supporting this conclusion. Although our \napproach is highly simplified, we expect this method can provide a \nuseful tool for deriving the approximate porosity and pellet size of the \ntechnical catalyst body for practical applications. \n4.Conclusion \nThrough a comparative investigation of Ru-BaO catalysts impreg -\nnated on supports with different MgO contents, our findings highlight \nthe pivotal role of support composition in catalytic activity. The Ru-Ba/ \nMgO catalyst yields superior NH3 synthesis activity, significantly lower \nactivation energy, as well as different reaction order compared to Ru- \nBa/MgAlO x catalysts, showcasing the critical role of MgO in maximizing \nthe catalytic performance of Ru-BaO. While MgO hardly promotes Ru \ndirectly, it primarily maintains robust basicity to the deposited BaO. \nThis empowered BaO can serve as an effective electronic promoter for \nRu, establishing strong active e\u0000@Ru/H@BaO sites that accelerate \nNH3 synthesis by mitigating H poisoning, facilitating N2 activation, and \nNHx stabilization. In contrast, the presence of AlO x domains within the \nMgO-Al 2O3 mixed oxide appears to compromise the basicity of BaO, \nthereby hindering its role as a promoter, forming weak active site which \nhas similar activation energy with non-promoted Ru. This study sheds \nlight on the often ambiguous role of MgO as a support for Ru-BaO cat-\nalysts in NH3 synthesis. MgO contributes to the promotion of the catalyst \nthrough a domino effect. From a broader perspective, this work offers a \nFig. 7.Correlation between pellet radius and Mears number of the Ru-Ba/ \nMgO100 catalyst at 678 K, 5 MPa, and N2/H2 1/3.
