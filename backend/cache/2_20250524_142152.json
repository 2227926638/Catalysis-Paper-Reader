Given that the traditional Haber–\nBosch (H-B) process requires very high temperature and\npressure, it is imperative to develop catalysts capable\nof facilitating ammonia synthesis under mild conditions.\nIn this work, a post-metal replacement strategy is\ndeveloped to improve the Fe loading in single-atom\nFe-implanted N-doped carbon catalysts. Starting from\nthe Zn–Fe–N–C material with single-atom Zn and Fe\nsites coexisting in N-doped porous carbon pyrolyzed\nfrom porphyrinic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), the\nreplacement of single-atom Zn with Fe sites is performed,\nwhich signiﬁcantly increases the Fe loading from 1.33 to\n2.39 wt%. This effectively suppresses the migration and\nagglomeration of Fe, yielding Fe–N–C with high metal\nloading (Fe HL–N–C). Notably, the Fe HL–N–C catalyst\nexhibits a catalytic rate of 558 µmol·g cat−1·h−1at 300\n°C for ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure, far\nsurpassing the performance of the traditional dominant\nfused iron and even Ru-based precious metal catalysts.\nIntroduction\nAmmonia, as a crucial inorganic compound, plays sig-\nniﬁcant roles in diverse industrial sectors encompassing\nfertilizer and pharmaceutical production.[1–6]With notably\nhigh hydrogen content (17.7 wt%) and substantial energy\ndensity (3.5 kW h·kg−1), ammonia is a highly storable and\ntransportable substance that can serve as a contender for\n[*] Y.Jiang,T.Peng,L.Jiao,H.-L.Jiang,X.Bao\nHefeiNationalResearchCenterforPhysicalSciencesatthe\nMicroscale,SchoolofChemistryandMaterialsScience,Universityof\nScienceandTechnologyofChina,Hefei,Anhui230026,P.R.China\nE-mail:jianglab@ustc.edu.cn\nxhbao@dicp.ac.cn\nY.Jiang,Z.Chen,X.Pan,X.Bao\nStateKeyLaboratoryofCatalysis,DalianNationalLaboratoryfor\nCleanEnergy,2011-CollaborativeInnovationCenterofChemistryfor\nEnergyMaterials,DalianInstituteofChemicalPhysics,Chinese\nAcademyofSciences,Dalian,Liaoning116023,P.R.China\nHomepage: http://mof.ustc.edu.cn/\nAdditionalsupportinginformationcanbefoundonlineinthe\nSupportingInformationsectiona carbon-free energy vector.[7,8]Although the synthesis of\nammonia from nitrogen (N 2) holds paramount signiﬁcance\nfor human civilization, the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch\nprocess, operated under high temperatures and pressures, is\nstill the predominant industrial-scale ammonia production\nroute, resulting in 2% of global energy consumption and\n1.4% of global CO 2emissions.[9–11 ]Implementing ammonia\nsynthesis under mild conditions remains a great challenge, and\nthe development of cost-effective catalysts that can produce\nammonia efﬁciently is highly desired.[12–14 ]\nTraditionally, iron (Fe) or ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts\nare the most commonly used for ammonia synthesis in\nindustry. However, this process requires substantial energy\ninput to dissociate molecular N 2due to the extraordinarily\nstable triple bond (945 kJ·mol−1).[15–17 ]To enhance the\ncatalytic production of NH 3under mild conditions, the\nperformance of Fe and Ru-based catalysts requires addi-\ntional optimization and improvement. Previous investigations\nindicate that ammonia synthesis is sensitive to catalyst\nstructure, and even minor structural modiﬁcations can result\nin signiﬁcant changes in catalytic activity.[18,19 ]Therefore,\nprecise fabrication of catalysts at the atomic scale is crucial\nfor achieving optimal catalytic performance. Single-atom\ncatalysts (SACs), characterized by atomically dispersed metal\ncenters, ensure uniformity of the catalytic metal sites and\nenable precise design and regulation of their coordination\nenvironments.[20–25 ]This offers signiﬁcant opportunities for\nthe development of highly efﬁcient catalysts toward catalyzing\nNH 3synthesis under mild conditions.[26–31 ]However, due\nto the high surface energy, single-atom sites are prone to\nsintering during preparation or catalytic reactions; to avoid\nthis, low metal loading in SACs is typically required.[32–34 ]\nEstablishing a construction methodology for stable SACs,\nparticularly with high metal loadings, is highly desirable yet\nremains a signiﬁcant challenge.\nMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs),[35–39 ]featuring well-\ndeﬁned structures, high porosity, large surface area, easy\ntailorability, and adjustable chemical composition, have\nattracted extensive interest in heterogeneous catalysis.[40–43 ]\nIn recent years, MOFs have been recognized as ideal pre-\ncursors for accurately constructing SACs via pyrolysis.[44–52 ]\nThe obtained SACs derived from MOFs largely inherit\nthe precursors’ high surface area and porous structure,\nfacilitating the exposure of active sites and promoting efﬁcient\nmass transfer during the catalytic process.[46,47 ]Consequently,\nMOFs exhibit substantial potential for the precise fabrication\nand performance enhancement of SACs for various catalytic\nAngew.

Subsequently, both ZrO 2\nand Zn atoms are removed by acid etching, creating numerous\nhigh-energy Zn vacancies that can be easily decorated with\nother metal atoms. When external Fe atoms are introduced\nby a post-metal replacement strategy, they can spontaneously\noccupy the Zn vacancies, forming additional single-atom Fe\nsites by Fe–N coordination to lower the system energy. In\nthis way, the Fe HL–N–C with increased single-atom Fe loading\nis elaborately fabricated. Notably, the Fe HL–N–C catalyst\nefﬁciently catalyzes ammonia synthesis under mild conditions,\nexhibiting a catalytic rate of 558 µmol·g cat−1·h−1at 300 °C and\n1 bar. However, the traditional industrial fused Fe catalyst and\nCo3Mo 3N catalyst necessitate harsher conditions to achieve\ncomparable ammonia production rates. For example, at 300\n°C and 10 bar, their catalytic activities are measured to be 346\nand 423 µmol·g cat−1·h−1, respectively.[53]\nResultsandDiscussion\nA series of isostructural porphyrinic MOFs, denoted as Fe x-\nPCN-222 (x%: mole percentage of Fe-TCPP in the totalsum of Fe-TCPP and nonmetallic H 2-TCPP linkers, x =10,\n20, 40, and 80), have been successfully constructed using\na previously reported mixed linker strategy (Figure S1).[50]\nUpon the pyrolysis of Fe x–PCN–222 in N 2atmosphere at\n800 °C followed by the removal of ZrO 2,F e x–N–C (x =10,\n20, 40, and 80) can be successfully obtained. Powder X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) patterns of all Fe x–N–C catalysts exhibit\ntwo broad peaks corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes\nof carbon, while no metallic phase is detected (Figure S2).\nThis manifests that Fe species exist in the form of single\natoms or small aggregates without the presence of large Fe\nparticles. To conﬁrm the existing form of Fe, X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS) analysis was performed, showing that\nno Fe–Fe bonding is detected in Fe 10–N–C and Fe 20–N–C,\nconﬁrming the atomic dispersion of Fe (Figures S3andS4), in\naccordance with the transmission electron microscope (TEM)\nobservation (Figures S5andS6). Unfortunately, the further\naddition of Fe-TCPP in Fe x-PCN-222 (x =40 and 80) results in\nthe formation of Fe nanoparticles with average particle sizes\nof 10.9 and 35.7 nm in Fe 40–N–C and Fe 80–N–C, respectively\n(Figures S7and S8). These ﬁndings support that Fe 20–N–C\nwith the Fe loading of 1.33 wt% is a crucial threshold for\nforming single-atom Fe sites via direct pyrolysis of Fe x-PCN-\n222, limiting the further increase of Fe loading (Table S1).\nAchieving atomic dispersion of metal sites at higher loadings\nremains a primary objective.\nTo achieve atomic dispersion of Fe at higher loadings,\na post-metal replacement strategy has been developed with\nthe assistance of Zn atoms to improve the Fe loading\nb a s e do nF e 20-PCN-222 (the precursor with the highest\nFe loading to obtain single-atom Fe by direct pyrolysis).\nSpeciﬁcally, by incorporating Zn into the non-metalized H 2-\nTCPP linkers of Fe 20-PCN-222, then Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222 is\nsynthesized with the vacant porphyrin centers in the parent\nFe20–PCN–222 occupied by Zn ions (Figure S9). Scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM) reveals the retained rod-like\nmorphology of Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222 with an approximate diam-\neter of 280 nm (Figure 1a). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)\nspectroscopy illustrates that the porphyrins in Zn–Fe 20–PCN-\n222 exhibit a slight broadening and redshift of the Soret\nband compared to PCN-222 involving non-metalized H 2-\nTCPP linkers, along with the reduced number of Q bands\nto two, manifesting a more symmetrical molecular structure\n(Figure S10). This conﬁrms the metallization of all porphyrins\nin Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222.[54]The Fe HL–N–C can be obtained\nthrough two subsequent processing steps: 1) the pyrolysis\nof Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222 at 800 °C under N 2atmosphere; 2)\nthe acid etching of Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222 to remove Zn species\nand ZrO 2,followed by the decoration of external Fe atoms.\nSEM observation shows the rod-like morphology. Fe HL–\nN–C similar to Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222, yet with a noticeable\nsize shrinkage (Figure S11). The TEM image of Fe HL–N–\nC reveals no discernible Fe nanoparticles (Figure 1b). To\nprovide detailed evidence of the formation of single-atom Fe\nsites within Fe HL–N–C, the aberration-corrected high-angle\nannular dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(HAADF-STEM) is employed, and the isolated bright spots\nconﬁrm that the Fe atoms are atomically dispersed in Fe HL–\nN–C (Figure 1c).

These results preliminarily\nindicate the successful fabrication of single-atom Fe sites\nwithin Fe HL–N–C using the post-metal replacement strategy.\nXAS has been adopted to further support the formation\nof single Fe atoms in Fe HL–N–C from Zn–Fe 20–PCN-222. The\nlow content of Fe-TCPP (20% of the total linkers) in the MOF\neffectively prevents the migration and agglomeration of Fe\nspecies during the pyrolysis, leading to the formation of single-\natom Fe sites on N-doped carbon (Figure 2a). Additionally,\ngiven the low boiling point of Zn,[55]the produced Zn\nnanoparticles easily evaporate, leaving only single-atom Znspecies, as evidenced by the absence of Zn ─Zn bond in the\nFT-EXAFS spectrum (Figure 2b). As a result, Zn-Fe 20-PCN-\n222 is successfully converted to Zn 1-Fe 1-N-C/ZrO 2,ac a t a l y s t\ncontaining single-atom Fe (1.21 wt%) and Zn (1.05 wt%) on\nN-doped carbon (Figure S12a ,T a b l e S1). Further FT-EXAFS\nﬁttings reveal that both Fe and Zn atoms are isolated and\ncoordinated with four N atoms (Figure 2c,d). Subsequently,\nan acid-etching process is performed to remove Zn atoms due\nto the fragility of the Zn–N coordination bond. Meanwhile,\nZrO 2is also eliminated during the etching process, forming\nZnv–Fe 1–N–C with abundant Zn vacancies, as conﬁrmed by\nthe trace amount of Zn (0.25 wt%) detected by inductively\ncoupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES)\n(Table S1). The Fe–N coordination is more stable than Zn–\nN,[56]which is conﬁrmed by the well-retained Fe loading (1.49\nwt%) (Figure S12b ,T a b l e S1). The slight increase in the\nweight percent of Fe is likely due to the removal of ZrO 2.\nThe removal of single Zn atoms creates Zn vacancies with\nnumerous dangling bonds, forming Zn v–Fe 1–N–C materials\nwith speciﬁc regions of relatively high energy that external\nmetal atoms can readily reﬁll. By leveraging this unique\nfeature of Zn vacancies, additional Fe atoms are further\nintroduced to ﬁll these Zn vacancies in Zn v–Fe 1–N–C,\nforming Fe HL–N–C with a higher loading of Fe (2.39 wt%)\n(Table S1). Powder XRD pattern of Fe HL–N–C shows two\nbroad peaks corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes of\ncarbon, without any metallic phases (Figure S13). Nitrogen\nsorption measurement of Fe HL–N–C shows a surface area of\n177.7 m2·g−1with moderate pore structures (Figure S14).\nTo identify the chemical composition and electronic\nstate of Fe HL-N-C, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\nanalysis is performed. The N 1s XPS spectrum of Fe HL-N-C\ndemonstrates ﬁve ﬁtted characteristic peaks corresponding to\npyridinic N (397.9 eV), Fe–N xspecies (398.7 eV), pyrrolic N\n(399.9 eV), graphitic N (400.9 eV), and oxidized N (403.1 eV)\n(Figure 3a).[50]The peak of Fe–N xindicates the presence of\nFe─N bonding in Fe HL–N–C.\nFurthermore, XAS is further utilized to provide additional\ninsights into the electronic state and coordination structure\nof Fe in Fe HL–N–C. In the Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-\nedge structure (XANES) spectra, the energy absorption edge\nof Fe HL–N–C, located between that of Fe foil and Fe 2O3,\nsigniﬁes that Fe is in a positive charge state (Figure 3b).\nNotably, the FT-EXAFS spectrum of Fe HL–N–C exhibits only\na predominant peak at approximately 1.4 Å, attributed to\nthe Fe–N scattering path, with no Fe–Fe peak at 2.2 Å,\nsuggesting the exclusive formation of single-atom Fe sites\n(Figure 3c). Furthermore, FT-EXAFS ﬁtting indicates that\neach Fe atom is coordinated with four N atoms, similar to that\nin Fe 20–N–C and Zn v–Fe 1–N–C (Figure 3d). The results above\nclearly demonstrate that the post-metal replacement strategy\neffectively constructs single-atom Fe catalysts with improved\nFe loading up to 2.39 wt%. For comparison, Fe–Fe 20–N–C\nwith a Fe loading of 3.25 wt% has been further fabricated by\ndirectly modifying Fe on Fe 20–N–C without introducing Zn\n(Table S1). The absence of Zn vacancies to anchor Fe atoms\nresults in the formation of a large number of Fe nanoparticles\nin Fe–Fe 20–N–C (Figure S15). This strongly proves that the\npost-metal replacement strategy, which decorates Fe with Zn\nAngew. Chem. Int.

Among the series of Fe x–N–C cat-\nalysts, the Fe 20–N–C presents the most optimal performance,\nachieving an ammonia production rate of 354 µmol·g cat−1·h−1\n(Figure 4a). Despite the higher metal loading, Fe 40–N–C\nand Fe 80–N–C exhibit inferior catalytic activity compared\nto Fe 20–N–C, highlighting the advantages of single-atom\nFe sites over Fe nanoparticles (Figure 4a). Moreover, in\ncontrast to Fe 10–N–C, which also contains single-atom Fe\nsites, Fe 20–N–C demonstrates enhanced catalytic performance\nowing to its higher Fe loading (Figure 4a). Based on the\ncatalytic performance comparison of Fe x–N–C samples, it can\nbe concluded that increasing Fe loading while maintaining\natomic Fe dispersion is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity.\nInspired by this, Fe HL–N–C with a higher single-atom\nFe loading is further adopted for NH 3synthesis. Strikingly,\nFeHL–N–C exhibits exceptionally high activity up to 558\nµmol·g cat−1·h−1, which is even higher than that of Fe 20–N–\nC( F i g u r e 4a). Moreover, Fe HL–N–C outperforms previously\nreported non-precious metal catalysts that operate under\nambient pressure in catalytic processes (Figure 4b). It demon-\nstrates superior performance at lower temperature, even\nsurpassing the industrial fused Fe catalyst and Co 3Mo 3N\ncatalyst as well as some precious metal-based catalysts\n(Figure 4b,T a b l e S2).

It is found that Fe–Fe 20–\nN–C presents an NH 3synthesis activity of 347 µmol·g cat−1·h−1,\nwhich is comparable to Fe 20–N–C yet much lower than that of\nFeHL–N–C (Figures S17andS18). The catalytic performance\nof the Zn v–Fe 1–N–C catalyst is also evaluated, achieving a\nrate of 360 µmol·g cat−1·h−1(Figures S17andS18). Despite the\npresence of trace amount of Zn in Zn v–Fe 1–N–C, its activity is\nsimilar to that of Fe 20–N–C, suggesting that the trace amount\nof Zn does not inﬂuence the catalytic performance. These\nresults indicate that the post-metal replacement strategy\nprovides an effective way to improve ammonia synthesis\nactivity under mild conditions by increasing the content of\nsingle-atom Fe sites.\nThe apparent activation energy (E a)f o rN H 3produc-\ntion over Fe HL–N–C and Fe 20–N–C, obtained from the\nArrhenius plots, is empirically determined to be 38.41 and\n44.39 kJ·mol−1, respectively (Figure 4c). However, the E a\nof the iron nanoparticle catalyst Fe 80–N–C is 80.21 kJ·mol−1\n(Figure 4c), much higher than those of the Fe 20–N–C and\nFeHL–N–C with single-atom Fe sites. This clearly demon-\nstrates the superiority of single-atom Fe sites for NH 3\nsynthesis. Moreover, the E avalue of Fe HL–N–C and Fe 20–N–C\nis substantially lower than those of representative Fe- and Ru-\nbased catalysts (80–140 kJ·mol−1), indicating that the cleavage\nof N≡N triple bonds is no longer the rate-determining\nstep.[58,59 ]In contrast, the E avalues for NH 3production over\nFeHL–N–C and Fe 20–N–C are comparable to those of Co–\nN–C ( ∼50 kJ·mol−1),[26]Ru/HZ SAC ( ∼38 kJ·mol−1),[30]\na n dR uS A s / S - 1( ∼55.4 kJ·mol−1).[31]These researchers\nAngew.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nResearchArticle\nreported that these catalysts follow an associative mechanism,\nwhere the formation of NH xis the rate-determining step.\nAccordingly, an Ar temperature programmed desorption\nmass spectrometry (Ar-TPD-MS) analysis of the Fe HL–N–C\ncatalyst is conducted after NH 3synthesis (Figure S19). The\n*N2H species, which is formed by the direct hydrogenation\nof N 2without breaking the N ≡N bond, is detected, clearly\nindicating that N 2undergoes an associative mechanism on the\nsingle-atom Fe sites of the Fe HL–N–C catalyst.\nTo further verify that the single-atom Fe sites are the\nreal catalytic sites, the activity of the N–C catalyst without\nFe is also tested. The result indicates that N–C shows no\nactivity at 300 °C and 0.1 MPa, conﬁrming the signiﬁcance\nof single-atom Fe sites for ammonia synthesis (Table S3).\nMoreover, the FePc, which also features Fe–N 4sites similar\nto Fe HL–N–C, is tested at 300 °C and 0.1 MPa (Figure S20).\nIt is found that the FePc presents an extremely low activity\nfor ammonia synthesis in long-term operations. The initial\nNH 3concentration likely originates from the hydrogenation\nof unstable nitrogen species. This further indicates that Fe–N 4\nsites decorated in carbon support are much superior to iron\nphthalocyanine molecules. Moreover, other non-precious\nmetal atoms have also been post-decorated into Zn v–Fe 1–\nN–C to form Ni–Fe–N–C and Co–Fe–N–C (Table S4).\nCompared with Fe HL–N–C, the Ni–Fe–N–C and Co–Fe–N–C\nshow decreased activity (Figure S21). The discrepancy arises\nfrom their distinct N 2adsorption capacities. According to\nthe Sabatier principle, an optimal catalyst requires moderate\nadsorption capacity for reactive species. The Fe species\nexhibits a suitable nitrogen adsorption capacity, promoting\nthe adsorption and subsequent activation of N 2. In contrast,\nthe Co and Ni demonstrate comparatively weaker nitrogen\nadsorption capabilities, which consequently impede the\nadsorption and activation processes of N 2.[60–62 ]The results\nfurther prove the superiority of Fe sites.\nDifferent carrier gases are fed to the isothermal reaction\nof Fe HL–N–C to verify whether the coordinated N species\nin Fe HL–N–C participate in ammonia synthesis. When 10%\nH2/Ar without N 2is used as the carrier gas, no ammonia\nsignal is detected at 300 °C and 0.1 MPa (Figure S22). This\nindicates that ammonia does not originate from nitrogen\natoms within the Fe HL–N–C. To further prove this, when\n14N2/H2is fed into the system, only14NH 3is observed,\nwhereas switching to15N2/H2results in the formation of\n15NH 3exclusively (Figure S22). These results further demon-\nstrate that the coordinated N species do not participate in\nammonia synthesis.\nAlso, the speciﬁc role of the alkali metal KNa alloy\nused in catalysis has been investigated. The N–C catalyst\nwith KNa does not demonstrate good activity (Table S3),\nconﬁrming that KNa is not a catalytic site. Furthermore, it\nis found that Fe HL–N–C without KNa exhibits much lower\nactivity compared to that in the presence of KNa. This\nsuggests that, while KNa is not the catalytic site, it serves as\na good promoter for Fe, signiﬁcantly enhancing the activity\n(Table S3). A similar activity improvement is also observed\nfor both Fe 10–N–C and Fe 20–N–C (Table S3). XPS results\nreveal that the introduction of KNa reduces the bindingenergy of Fe in Fe HL–N–C (Figure S23), indicating that\nKNa could donate electrons to form electron-rich single-\natom Fe sites. Analogous ﬁndings have also been found\nwhen KNa is introduced to Fe x–N–C (x =10, 20, 40, and\n80) (Figures S24–S27 ). The activation of N 2begins with its\nadsorption onto Fe sites, followed by electron transfer from\nFe to the π-backbonding orbitals of N ≡N.[63]The formation\nof electron-enriched Fe with the assistance of alkali metal\npromoter signiﬁcantly weakens the N ≡N bond, facilitating\nthe subsequent hydrogenation processes and the formation of\nNH 3.[64]\nIn addition, the stability measurement has also been\nperformed, revealing that Fe HL–N–C maintains its excellent\nstability, exceeding 20 h with no signiﬁcant loss in activity\n(Figure 4d). Additionally, the catalytic activity of the Fe HL–\nN–C exhibits an approximately linear increase with rising\npressure from 0.3 to 5 Mpa (Figure S28). The results demon-\nstrate that hydrogen poisoning on Fe HL–N–C can be avoided.\nDuring the isothermal H 2reduction experiment of Fe HL–N–C\nat 300 °C and 0.1 MPa (Figure S29), no discernible methane\nformation signal is detected, demonstrating the high stability\nof the carbon support under these conditions. Powder XRD\nand TEM characterizations for the used Fe HL–N–C catalyst\nexhibit consistent results with those before the reaction, with\nno evidence of Fe agglomeration, further conﬁrming the\nstability of the catalyst (Figures S30andS31). The ammonia\nsynthesis rate of the Fe HL–N–C catalyst is also investigated\nat 0.1 MPa and different temperatures. The results indicate\nthat outlet ammonia can be detected at temperatures as low\nas 200 °C; the ammonia production activity steadily increases\nalong with temperature, as expected (Figure S32).\nConclusion\nIn summary, a post-metal replacement strategy has been\ndeveloped to fabricate a single-atom Fe catalyst (Fe HL–N–C)\nwith increased Fe loading. This approach involves the synthe-\nsis of Zn–Fe–N–C with the co-decoration of single-atom Zn\nand Fe sites on N-doped porous carbon through the pyrolysis\nof a porphyrinic MOF (Zn-Fe 20-PCN-222). Following the sub-\nstitution of single-atom Zn with Fe sites, Fe HL–N–C, featuring\nimproved Fe loading while maintaining single-atom Fe dis-\npersion, is successfully obtained. Notably, Fe HL–N–C exhibits\nexceptional catalytic performance toward ammonia synthesis\nunder mild conditions. At atmospheric pressure, Fe HL–N–C\nachieves an activity of up to 558 µmol·g cat−1·h−1for NH 3pro-\nduction at 300 °C, surpassing all the lower-loading single-atom\nFe catalysts (Fe 10–N–C and Fe 20–N–C), iron nanoparticle\ncatalysts (Fe 40–N–C and Fe 80–N–C), and even traditional\nfused Fe catalyst and Co 3Mo 3N catalyst. Moreover, under\ncomparable reaction conditions, the activity of Fe HL–N–\nC exceeds that of nearly all reported non-precious metal\ncatalysts and even some precious metal catalysts. In addition,\nthe catalytic activity remains for over 20 h without signiﬁcant\ndecline. This work introduces an innovative approach to the\npreparation of single-atom catalysts with improved metal\nAngew. Chem. Int.
